                The journey of ShaadiSaathi began in 2014 when our founders, Anand and Mehak, experienced firsthand the challenges of planning their own wedding. They realized that despite India having one of the largest wedding industries in the world, couples lacked a centralized platform to discover and connect with reliable vendors.

                  "We wanted to create something that would make wedding planning enjoyable rather than overwhelming. Every couple deserves to focus on the joy of their celebration instead of the stress of coordination."

                Starting with just a small team working out of a tiny office in Delhi, ShaadiSaathi began by curating a list of 100 vendors across three categories. The platform quickly gained traction as couples appreciated the verified reviews, detailed portfolios, and transparent pricing information.

                By 2016, we had expanded to five major cities and introduced our innovative planning tools, including the Budget Calculator and Guest List Manager. These tools were designed specifically for Indian weddings, considering their unique cultural elements and family dynamics.
